Summary : American Sign Language (ASL) is a vital mode
of communication for individuals with hearing impairments.
Advances in technology have led to the development of systems
that bridge the communication gap between sign language users
and the wider community. This unique and expressive language
relies on handshapes, facial expressions, and body movements
to convey meaning. A standard approach involves collecting a
diverse dataset of ASL gestures, preprocessing the data to extract
relevant features, and training a machine learning model, such
as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to recognize these
gestures. The trained model would be capable of converting
hand and finger movements captured through video recordings
into text, thereby enabling seamless communication between
ASL users and those unfamiliar with sign language. This paper
offers insights into the technical aspects of ASL detection using
machine learning and underscores its potential to revolutionise
communication inclusivity for diverse communities
